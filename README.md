The original version can be found [here](https://github.com/YunseolPark/Internship-Evaluation_of_Yellow_Carpet). While all explanations, reports, etc. have been translated, the data is left as is. However, most of the Korean words in the data that are relevant to the analysis will be explained in each process.
